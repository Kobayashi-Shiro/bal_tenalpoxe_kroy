### Uni of York Physics - Yr2 Astrophysics python lab materials 

(updated 7/2020)


This repo contains the starting code to be given to the students and the solution. This solution is the simplest method of solving the problem presented in the lab script. If anyone can come up with a better code (within the second years' capability) that'd be much appreciated. 


The first part of the lab will be delivered in a workshop-ish style, with several checkpoints. This is because most students were unable to independently design an algorithm but we would like to allow for some thinking and discussing time. Details are outlined in the solution. Do not let them know they are going to have a starting code prior to that. They will also be using the same set of data (Kep45.txt) to avoid requiring further 'special codes' to deal with unusual weird-looking data from the archive. Well let them go ahead if they wish, provided that they have the skills - I mean there are geniuses. 


Demonstrator - please make sure everyone is on the right track from the very beginning. If the first step is wrong it will be impossible to get the four points, and it will be hard to correct their codes without wiping away their entire piece of work. 


I have also included a short revision notes with a mini exercise that I expect them to complete before the lab. Most are from first year lab materials; I have added an intro to lists and append() which are not covered in first year and they will need to know this for completing the tasks. But everything should be straight-forward. Most will not find the skills hard, the hardest bit would be the algorithm and how to solve an actual real-world problem using these python tools. Person reading this please help me put it on the vle, and add a few more examples/ exercises. 


Cheers,
